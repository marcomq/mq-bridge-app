# Homebrew distribution

Two artifacts, both served from the tap repo **`marcomq/homebrew-tap`** (a
separate GitHub repo — Homebrew requires the `homebrew-` name prefix and clones
it whole; it is *not* a folder of this repo):

| Install | Command | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI / MCP server (**formula**) | `brew install marcomq/tap/mq-bridge-app` | Headless binary, installed as both `mq-bridge-app` and the short `mqb`, same asset `cargo binstall` uses |
| Desktop UI (**cask**) | `brew install --cask marcomq/tap/mq-bridge` | The Tauri `.app`, dragged into `/Applications` |

The tap repo is the **only** home for the formula and cask. This repo holds no
`.rb` files — [`render.sh`](render.sh) generates them (with real checksums pulled
from the release assets) and the release CI job pushes them to the tap. Nothing
to keep in sync, nothing to drift.

```text
marcomq/homebrew-tap          ← the tap (installs read from here)
├── Formula/mq-bridge-app.rb  ← CLI / MCP server
└── Casks/mq-bridge.rb        ← desktop UI
```

## macOS vs Linux

Homebrew runs on **both macOS and Linux** ("Homebrew on Linux"), but the two
artifact types don't: **formulae work on macOS and Linux; casks are macOS-only.**
So the CLI is `brew install`-able on both platforms; the desktop UI is a cask and
therefore Mac-only — Linux desktop users take the `.deb` / `.AppImage` from the
GitHub release directly.

## Coverage / limits

- **Formula (CLI)** covers macOS Apple Silicon and Linux x86_64 (the two
  `mq-bridge-cli-*.tar.gz` assets the release builds). Intel macOS / arm64 Linux
  aren't covered until the release matrix builds those targets.
- **Cask (UI)** is macOS Apple Silicon only — casks are macOS-only and the `.dmg`
  is built for `aarch64` only. Its `zap` stanza uses the app's real bundle id
  (`com.marcomq.mqbridgeapp`).

Both installs are a single ~20 MB prebuilt download (no compilation) and complete
in seconds — the formula copies the released binary, the cask drops the `.app`
into `/Applications`.

## Bootstrapping / updating the tap by hand

`render.sh <version>` writes `Formula/mq-bridge-app.rb` and `Casks/mq-bridge.rb`
into an output dir with real checksums. To (re)populate the tap for a given
release:

```bash
# from this repo root
packaging/homebrew/render.sh 0.2.8 marcomq/mq-bridge-app /tmp/tap-out

git clone https://github.com/marcomq/homebrew-tap
mkdir -p homebrew-tap/Formula homebrew-tap/Casks
cp /tmp/tap-out/Formula/mq-bridge-app.rb homebrew-tap/Formula/
cp /tmp/tap-out/Casks/mq-bridge.rb       homebrew-tap/Casks/
cd homebrew-tap && git add Formula Casks \
  && git commit -m "mq-bridge 0.2.8" && git push
```

Verify:

```bash
brew install marcomq/tap/mq-bridge-app        # CLI formula
mqb --version
brew test marcomq/tap/mq-bridge-app           # runs the formula's test block
brew install --cask marcomq/tap/mq-bridge      # desktop UI cask
```

> Current tap state (0.2.8): both `Formula/mq-bridge-app.rb` and
> `Casks/mq-bridge.rb` are present and install. The formula still carries an older
> header comment; it self-corrects on the next release once CI runs, or re-render
> and push the formula to refresh it now.

## Automating the bump on release

The `update-homebrew-tap` job below is **already in**
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. It `needs` the jobs that produce the CLI
tarballs *and* the Tauri bundle, runs `render.sh` against the freshly published
assets, and pushes both files to the tap — so the formula text lives in exactly
one place (`render.sh`), never duplicated in YAML.

It authenticates to the tap with an **SSH deploy key** (deploy keys don't expire,
unlike fine-grained PATs which are capped at ~1 year — so there's no yearly
rotation that can silently break the release). One-time setup:

```bash
# 1. Generate a keypair (no passphrase)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "homebrew-tap deploy" -f tap_deploy_key -N ""

# 2. Add the PUBLIC key to the tap as a write-enabled deploy key:
#    github.com/marcomq/homebrew-tap → Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key
#    → paste tap_deploy_key.pub, tick "Allow write access"

# 3. Store the PRIVATE key as a secret on THIS repo:
gh secret set HOMEBREW_TAP_DEPLOY_KEY -R marcomq/mq-bridge-app < tap_deploy_key

# 4. Delete the local copies
rm tap_deploy_key tap_deploy_key.pub
```

Until the key is set, the job runs but its push step fails.
