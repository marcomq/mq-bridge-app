# Endpoints (connectors)

An **endpoint** is a source (consumer) or sink (publisher) for messages. Every endpoint —
whatever the underlying protocol — is driven behind the same `receive_batch` / `send_batch`
shape, so any source can feed any sink. In config, an endpoint is a single-key object naming
the connector:

```yaml
input:  { kafka:   { url: "localhost:9092", topic: "orders" } }
output: { mongodb: { url: "mongodb://localhost:27017", database: "app", collection: "orders" } }
```

This page catalogs the transport endpoints and their behaviour. For per-connector query
parameters used by `copy` (name, type, default, required, description), see the generated
[URL parameter reference](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge-app/tree/main/dev/docs/reference)
and the hand-written [connector pages](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge-app/tree/main/dev/docs/connectors).
Structural endpoints (`ref`, `fanout`, `switch`, `response`, …) are documented separately in
[Structural endpoints](../engine/reference.md).

## Supported transports

Kafka, NATS, AMQP (RabbitMQ), MQTT, MongoDB, **Postgres CDC** (logical replication),
PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite / MariaDB (SQLx), ClickHouse, HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, ZeroMQ,
Redis Streams, AWS SQS/SNS, cloud object storage (S3 / GCS / Azure), IBM MQ, files, and
in-memory channels (`memory`, in-process and cross-process IPC).

## Consumer vs. subscriber, and nack support

Endpoints default to a **Consumer** pattern (a queue: messages are distributed among
workers). To get **Subscriber** (pub/sub) behaviour, per-backend config is required.

| Backend | Subscriber Config (Pub/Sub) | Request-Reply | Nack Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AMQP** | Set `subscribe_mode: true` | Emulated (Property) | **Yes** (Basic.nack) |
| **AWS** | N/A (Use SNS) | No | **Yes** (Visibility Timeout) |
| **File** | Set `mode: subscribe` | No | Simulated (In-Memory) |
| **gRPC** | N/A | No | No |
| **HTTP** | N/A | **Native** (Implicit) | **Yes** (HTTP 500) |
| **IBM MQ** | Set `topic` | No | **Yes** (Tx Rollback) |
| **Kafka** | Omit `group_id` | Emulated (Header) | Eventual (Skip Offset) |
| **Memory** (in-process) | Set `subscribe_mode: true` | Emulated (Metadata) | **Yes** (Re-queue), by default **disabled** |
| **Memory** (IPC: `ipc://`, `unix://`, `pipe://`) | Not supported | Not supported | **Yes** (Re-queue), by default **enabled**, consumer-local |
| **MongoDB** | Set `consume: subscriber` | Emulated (Metadata) | **Yes** (Unlock) |
| **MQTT** | Set `clean_session: true` | Emulated (Property) | Eventual (Skip Ack) |
| **NATS** | Set `subscriber_mode: true` | **Native** (Inbox) | **Yes** (JetStream Nak) |
| **Postgres CDC** | N/A (streams committed changes) | No | **Yes** (confirmed LSN not advanced) |
| **Redis Streams** | Set `subscriber_mode: true` | No | Eventual (PEL, un-acked) |
| **Sled** | Set `delete_after_read: false` | No | **Yes** (Tx Rollback) |
| **SQLx** | Not supported | No | Eventual (Skip Delete) |
| **WebSocket** | N/A | No | No |
| **ZeroMQ** | Set `socket_type: "sub"` | **Native** (REQ/REP) | No |

- **Request-Reply** — *Native* uses protocol-level correlation (HTTP connection, NATS reply
  subject). *Emulated* publishes a new message to a reply destination (the `reply_to`
  metadata field) carrying a `correlation_id`.
- **Nack** — *Yes* is explicit negative acknowledgement triggering redelivery. *Eventual*
  means redelivery depends on timeout or a connection drop. *Simulated* is handled in-memory.
  *Consumer-local* means the nacked message is retried inside the consumer process and is lost
  if that process dies — the producer is never notified.

## Database sources: change capture vs. polling

Databases have no native pub/sub, so a database source is read one of two ways:

- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** tails the database's own change log — inserts **and**
  updates/deletes — and resumes from a durable log position.
  - **PostgreSQL** — the `postgres_cdc` endpoint streams a logical-replication slot
    (`pgoutput`). It emits flat JSON rows tagged with `postgres.operation` metadata
    (`insert`/`update`/`delete`/`truncate`). Acking a batch confirms the LSN back to the
    server; a nack or interrupted run does **not** advance the confirmed LSN, so replication
    resumes from the last acknowledged position — at-least-once. Enable with the
    `postgres-cdc` feature; requires `wal_level = logical` and a publication. See the
    [Postgres CDC → JSONL](../tutorials/postgres-cdc.md) tutorial.
  - **MongoDB** — set `consume: capture_new` to watch an existing collection for changes from
    now on, or `consume: capture_all` to read existing documents first and then keep capturing
    (no gap, at-least-once). It emits `insert`/`update`/`replace`/`delete` tagged with
    `mongodb.operation` and checkpoints under `cursor_id`. Change streams need a replica set.
- **Cursor polling** pages an existing table by a monotonic `cursor_column`
  (`WHERE col > $last ORDER BY col ASC`), persisting the last read value under `cursor_id`.
  Captures **appends only** — updates and deletes are not observed. Available on **SQLx**
  (PostgreSQL / MySQL / MariaDB / SQLite) and **ClickHouse**; the poll interval backs off
  exponentially between `polling_interval_ms` and `max_polling_interval_ms`. **SQLite** and
  **ClickHouse** are polling-only.

> **SQLx read mode is chosen by config, not by driver.** With **no** `cursor_column`, an SQLx
> source is a **competing-consumers work queue**: it atomically claims rows via a `locked_until`
> lease and deletes them on ack. This requires the table to carry the queue schema — an `id`, a
> `payload`, and a `locked_until` column — on **every** driver; it is **not** a plain full-table
> read. To read an arbitrary table non-destructively (the ETL path), set **`cursor_column`** to
> switch to cursor polling. A source table missing `locked_until` fails fast with a permanent
> error rather than reconnecting forever.

### MongoDB consume modes

| `consume` | mechanism | modifies source | ends on drain | use for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `consumer` (default) | claim → lock → re-fetch → delete | **yes** | yes | work queues, competing readers |
| `subscriber` | polls `seq > last_seq`, advancing a cursor | no | yes | ephemeral fan-out |
| `capture_new` | change stream, new changes only | no | **no** | ongoing CDC |
| `capture_all` | `_id` snapshot, then change stream | no | standalone only | bulk read / ETL |

These are not interchangeable. The default `consumer` buys exclusivity via four round trips
per batch; where you only need a single-reader bulk read or ETL pass, **use `capture_all`** —
it is roughly 5x faster (500k docs, standalone MongoDB: `consumer` → `null` 23,667 rows/s vs.
`capture_all` → jsonl 120,308 rows/s). Note `concurrency` does **not** speed up a MongoDB
source; batches are fetched serially.

## Cloud object storage (S3 / GCS / Azure)

The `object_store` endpoint (alias `s3`) reads and writes Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage,
Azure Blob, Cloudflare R2, and anything else the `object_store` crate speaks. Enable with the
`object-store` feature. Credentials and backend options come from the environment
(`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_REGION`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, …); the
URL scheme picks the backend (`s3://`, `gs://`, `az://`).

- **As a sink**, each flushed batch is encoded with the file formats (`normal` JSONL, `json`,
  `text`, `raw`) and written as **one immutable object** at
  `<prefix>/[YYYY/MM/DD/]<uuidv7>.<ext>`. Objects are write-once.
- **As a source**, objects under the prefix are listed in key order, fetched whole, split on
  the delimiter, and emitted. Progress is a durable cursor holding the last fully-acked object
  key: set `cursor_id` and an external `checkpoint_store` (`file://`, `s3://`, `postgres://`,
  `mongodb://`) so a restart resumes. Objects are **never deleted or rewritten**.

```yaml
archive_to_s3:
  input:  { memory: { topic: "events" } }
  output: { object_store: { url: "s3://my-bucket/events", format: normal } }

replay_from_s3:
  input:
    object_store:
      url: "s3://my-bucket/events"
      cursor_id: "replayer-1"
      checkpoint_store: "file:///var/lib/mqb/s3-cursor.json"
  output: { nats: { subject: "events.replay", url: "nats://localhost:4222" } }
```

> Point `checkpoint_store` at a **different** bucket/prefix than the source reads; a cursor
> object under the source prefix would be listed and re-read as data.

## File and object formats

Both `file` and `object_store` share the encodings: `normal`/`json`/`text` write the
`{message_id, payload, metadata}` wrapper (the message id survives the round trip); `raw`
writes payloads verbatim (bare documents, no wrapper). `csv` is supported as a source (and on
file sinks). The file endpoints also carry their own `compression` and `encryption` fields —
see the [Compression](../cookbook/compression.md) and
[Encryption at rest](../cookbook/encryption.md) recipes.

## Memory endpoint and IPC

The `memory` endpoint is both an in-process channel and a cross-process IPC transport over
Unix domain sockets / Windows named pipes. Its `topic` field (alias `url`) doubles as a
transport URL. See the [Cross-process IPC bridge](../tutorials/ipc-bridge.md) tutorial and
[Learn the architecture](../engine/architecture.md#memory-endpoint-and-ipc-transport)
for the URL schemes, roles (consumer is server, publisher is client), wire format and
backpressure.

## IBM MQ

IBM MQ is included in the `full` feature set via the `ibm-mq` feature, which loads the IBM MQ
client library at runtime via dlopen — **no IBM SDK is needed to build**. The redistributable
client only has to be present at runtime, and only if you actually use an IBM MQ endpoint (it
is loaded lazily on first connect). The loader finds the client via the platform default name,
`MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH` (e.g. `/opt/mqm`), or an explicit `MQB_IBM_MQ_LIB` path. To link
statically at build time, use `ibm-mq-static` (requires the IBM MQ SDK). IBM MQ has its own
TLS shape (`IbmTlsConfig`): `tls.cert_file` (alias `key_repository`) is a CMS key repository
path, not a PEM file. See the
[IBM MQ setup guide](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge-app/blob/main/dev/docs/IBM_MQ_SETUP.md).

## Connection sharing

Publishers that target the same server reuse one underlying transport client by default,
consolidating TCP connections, background threads, and batching. Sharing applies to **Kafka,
NATS, MongoDB, SQLx, HTTP, and gRPC**; the client is keyed by connection-level settings (URL,
auth, TLS, client options), never by topic/subject/collection. Set `shared: false` on a
publisher to give it a dedicated connection — see
[Configuration grammar](../engine/configuration.md#connection-sharing) and
[Performance tuning](../operations/tuning.md#connection-pooling--reuse).

## Idempotent writes

For ETL, at-least-once delivery plus an **idempotent write** gives effective exactly-once. The
most robust place to enforce this is the sink's own unique constraint. See the
[Upserts & insert-if-absent](../cookbook/upserts.md) and
[Deduplication](../cookbook/deduplication.md) recipes for the per-sink mechanisms
(`id_field` on MongoDB, `ON CONFLICT`/`ON DUPLICATE KEY` on SQL, `ReplacingMergeTree` on
ClickHouse, deterministic `message_id` + `postgres.key` on Postgres CDC).
