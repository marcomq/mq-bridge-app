# Request / reply

`mq-bridge` supports request-response patterns for interactive services such as web
APIs. A client sends a request and waits for the matching response, while the bridge
keeps the correlation details away from your handler.

The `response` output is the most direct option and the safest one under concurrency:
the response stays in the same execution context as the request, so concurrent
requests do not share a reply queue or race on correlation IDs.

## How it works

1. An input endpoint that supports request-reply (like `http`) receives a request.
2. The message passes through the route's processing chain — this is where you attach
   a **handler** to process the request and generate a response payload.
3. The final message is sent to the `output`.
4. If the output is `response: {}`, the bridge sends the message back to the original
   input source, which delivers it as the reply (e.g. the HTTP response body).

## Example: MongoDB request/response

A sender writes a request document to MongoDB and waits for a reply. The bridge reads
the document, runs the handler, and writes the result back to the reply collection:

```yaml
mongo_responder:
  input:
    mongodb:
      url: "mongodb://localhost:27017"
      database: "app_db"
      collection: "requests"
  output:
    # 'response' sends the processed message back to the reply collection
    # (whatever reply_to the sender set).
    response: {}
```

## Attaching the handler (Rust)

The `response` output only echoes what the pipeline produced — you supply the logic by
attaching a handler to the route:

```rust
use mq_bridge::models::Handled;
use mq_bridge::CanonicalMessage;

let handler = |mut msg: CanonicalMessage| async move {
    let request_body = String::from_utf8_lossy(&msg.payload);
    let response_body = format!("Handled response for: {}", request_body);
    msg.payload = response_body.into();
    Ok(Handled::Publish(msg))
};
// load the route from YAML, then attach `handler` to its output and run it.
```

See [Embed the library](embedding.md) for the full load-and-run scaffolding, and
[Core concepts](../getting-started/concepts.md) for the handler model
(`CommandHandler` / `EventHandler` / `TypeHandler`).
