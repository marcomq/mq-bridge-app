# Cross-process IPC bridge

The `memory` endpoint is more than an in-process channel: its `url` (alias `topic`)
is a transport URL, so the same endpoint can bridge **separate processes** on one
machine over a Unix socket or Windows named pipe — no broker required.

## Transport URLs

The `url` field selects the transport:

| URL | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"name"` | `memory://name` — in-process, same process only |
| `"memory://name"` | in-process channel |
| `"ipc://name"` | Unix: `/run/mq-bridge/name.sock` (falls back to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mq-bridge`, then `/tmp/mq-bridge`). Windows: `\\.\pipe\mq-bridge-name` |
| `"ipc:///abs/path.sock"` | that exact socket path (Unix) |
| `"unix:///abs/path.sock"` | Unix only, path must be absolute |
| `"pipe://name"` | Windows only, `\\.\pipe\name` |

**The consumer side binds/listens and must be started before the publisher
connects.** IPC does not support `subscribe_mode` or `request_reply`. `enable_nack`
defaults to true, but redelivery is consumer-local: a nacked message is retried
inside the consumer and is lost if the consumer process dies.

## Example: ingest process → Kafka

One process reads from a Unix socket and forwards to Kafka. Start this consumer
**first** so the socket exists before any producer connects:

```yaml
ipc_ingest:
  input:
    memory:
      url: "ipc:///run/mq-bridge/orders.sock"
      capacity: 256
  output:
    kafka:
      topic: "orders"
      url: "localhost:9092"
```

```bash
mq-bridge-app --config ipc_ingest.yaml
```

Any other process on the same host can now publish into
`ipc:///run/mq-bridge/orders.sock` — via its own `mq-bridge` route, or programmatically
through a `Publisher` built on a `memory` endpoint (see the
[embedding tutorial](embedding.md)) — and the messages flow through to Kafka.

## When to use it

- **Decouple a producer and a sink into separate processes** without standing up a
  broker — e.g. an app writes to the socket, a long-lived bridge process owns the
  Kafka/DB connections and batching.
- **Language boundary.** A Python or Node process publishes into the socket; a Rust
  bridge process does the heavy I/O.

`capacity` bounds the in-flight channel; tune it alongside the guidance in
[Performance tuning](../operations/tuning.md).
