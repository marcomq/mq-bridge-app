# Observability & metrics

`mq-bridge-app` is production-ready with structured **JSON logging** and a **Prometheus** metrics
endpoint, plus per-route status you can query at runtime.

## Metrics

Attach the [`metrics`](../engine/reference.md#metrics) middleware to an endpoint to emit
throughput, latency, and error metrics. It requires the `metrics` feature and takes no options —
its presence enables collection. Input and output are labelled separately, so attaching it to
both sides is meaningful:

```yaml
orders_bridge:
  input:
    middlewares: [ { metrics: {} } ]
    kafka: { topic: "orders", url: "localhost:9092" }
  output:
    middlewares: [ { metrics: {} } ]
    nats: { subject: "orders.processed", stream: "orders_stream", url: "nats://localhost:4222" }
```

Metrics are exposed for a Prometheus scrape. Point your Prometheus (or Grafana Agent) at the
running server and build dashboards on the emitted throughput/latency/error series.

> ⚠️ **Metrics are not free.** The `metrics` middleware records a measurement per message on
> whichever side it is attached, so it adds per-message overhead and can measurably reduce
> throughput — most noticeably on **high-throughput endpoints** where per-message cost dominates.
> Enable it where you need visibility, not blanket-on every side of every route: attach it to the
> one endpoint you actually want to watch, and leave it off the hot path when chasing peak
> throughput. Benchmark numbers should be taken **without** it attached (see
> [Reading throughput honestly](#reading-throughput-honestly)).

## Logging

Logs are structured JSON, suited to shipping into a log aggregator. Two things to keep in mind:

- **Message payloads are emitted only at `trace` level.** Run production above `trace` so no
  sensitive data (e.g. cardholder data) reaches logs or traces. See the
  [TLS & security hardening](../engine/configuration.md#tls--security-hardening) notes.
- The MCP server's `stdio` transport owns **stdout** for the protocol, so its logs go to
  **stderr**. In HTTP transport this is not a concern.
- **At startup each route reports its inferred delivery guarantee** — `effectively-once` or
  `at-least-once`. It is read off the endpoint configuration, not enforced: the line tells you
  whether the source's identity and the sink's write add up to an idempotent pipeline. See
  [Delivery guarantees](../engine/delivery.md).

## Runtime route status

For a running bridge, query route health rather than reading logs:

- **In the UI**, the runtime status view shows live connection health and message counts per
  publisher/consumer/route.
- **Through the MCP server**, `list_routes` and `route_status` report `messages`,
  `messages_per_second` (instantaneous), `elapsed_s`, and `average_messages_per_second`. For a
  running route read the instantaneous rate; for a finished job read the average. See
  [MCP route status](../MCP.md#route-status).

## Reading throughput honestly

Whatever the source, a rate figure is only meaningful with its methodology:

- Measure on a **release build** — a debug build reports dramatically slower rates. Through MCP,
  call `server_info` first to confirm the build `profile`.
- The instantaneous rate of a **completed** job decays to ~0 within a second — use the *average*
  for finished work.
- Record CPU/cores/RAM and the exact `batch_size` / `concurrency` next to every number.
