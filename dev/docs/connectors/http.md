# HTTP

As a publisher, sends each message as an HTTP request to a target URL. As a
consumer, runs an embedded HTTP server and turns incoming requests into
messages.

## URL format

```
http://host[:port][/path]?method=<verb>
```

`http://`/`https://` pass through unchanged — they're already the native
scheme the driver expects (the target path, if any, is just part of the URL,
not a separate query param).

## Examples

**Consume a RabbitMQ queue and POST each message to an API, continuous:**

```bash
mq-bridge copy \
  --from rabbitmq://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f?queue=orders \
  --to http://internal-api.local/ingest?method=POST
```

**Run an HTTP listener as the source (webhook receiver), continuous:**

```bash
mq-bridge copy \
  --from http://0.0.0.0:8080?method=POST \
  --to kafka://kafka.local:9092?topic=webhooks
```

**Non-blocking publisher (don't wait for the downstream response):**

```bash
mq-bridge copy --drain \
  --from file:///data/events.jsonl?format=json \
  --to https://api.example.com/ingest?method=POST&request_timeout_ms=5000
```
