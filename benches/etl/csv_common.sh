# Each tool has its own runnable script (run_csv_mqb.sh, run_csv_sling.sh,
# run_csv_meltano.sh) so a single tool can be re-measured on its own; they all
# append to the same results CSV, and run_csv_to_jsonl.sh chains them plus the
# parity check. Splitting them up is why this file exists: the dataset, the
# output paths and the watchdog budgets have to agree across the scripts, or the
# parity check would be comparing outputs from different runs.
