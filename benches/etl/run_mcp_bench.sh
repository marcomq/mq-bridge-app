# The measuring is all in mcp_bench.py, which is a real MCP client over stdio: it
# spawns `mq-bridge-app mcp` and speaks JSON-RPC to it the way Claude Code does.
# Nothing here reaches into the process, so the numbers include the full
# interface cost an agent actually pays.
#
# This wrapper exists only so the scenario is entered the same way as the other
# eight (`benches/etl/run_*.sh`) and inherits the same dataset, defaults, watchdog
# budget and environment header from csv_common.sh/lib.sh. Re-implementing those
# in Python would fork the harness's conventions for one scenario.
#
# The same CSV -> JSONL job as scenario 6 is used on purpose: the point of the
# throughput number is that it matches the `copy` CLI figure, i.e. that the MCP
# interface costs one round-trip and nothing per row. Comparing it against a
# different workload would prove nothing.
