# Postgres -> file, against the tools that ship *with Postgres*.

#   ./seed.sh up && ./seed.sh bench 1000000   # prereq: the 1M-row `bench` table

#
# Why these tools, and which comparison is fair:
#
#   psql \copy TO CSV  — LIKE-FOR-LIKE. Both sides read the same table and write
#                        the same CSV bytes (the runner diffs them). This is the
#                        honest "how do you compare to what I already run?" number.
#   pg_dump            — REFERENCE FLOOR, NOT a head-to-head. It writes a *restore
#                        format* (a COPY-block SQL script), not interchange data,
#                        and it never decodes a row: the server streams COPY text
#                        and pg_dump forwards it. It is the cost of getting bytes
#                        out of Postgres at all, so it belongs in the table as the
#                        lower bound on any extraction — not as a competitor that
#                        was beaten or lost to.
#
# Deliberately NOT compared: pg_dump's custom/directory formats (compressed,
# parallel, restore-only) and `--data-only` row counts. Publishing a ratio against
# a dump format would be comparing different work and inviting the obvious
# objection.
