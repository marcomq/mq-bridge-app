#      wedged -- the signal is absorbed, the process lives, and the `wait` below
#      blocks forever. The watchdog fires and accomplishes nothing.
#   2. The command runs in its own process group (`set -m` makes it the leader,
#      so pgid == pid) and signals go to the whole group via `kill -- -$pid`.
#      Signalling only the direct child orphans everything it spawned -- meltano's
#      tap|target pipeline being the case that bit us.
#
# stdin is /dev/null: with job control on, a background job in its own process
# group that reads the terminal gets SIGTTIN and stops, which is another silent hang.

  #   - Killing only the subshell leaves the `sleep` it forked alive. That orphan
  #     inherits whatever stdout the script had, so if the harness output is piped
  #     or captured, the orphan holds the write end of the pipe open and the reader
  #     never sees EOF. A 2-second benchmark then appears to hang for the full
  #     timeout (200s per sample at 1M rows, and every sample leaves another one).
  #     Killing the whole group takes the `sleep` with it.

  #     it is not holding a descriptor the caller is waiting on.
