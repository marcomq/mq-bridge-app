# ETL / CDC benchmark harness (run through mq-bridge-app)

This harness produces **like-for-like ETL / data-movement numbers for the
mq-bridge engine, driven the way a real no-code user drives it** — through
`mq-bridge-app` configured by CLI/YAML, not a bespoke Rust harness. It mirrors
the scenarios and fixed parameters in the library's
[`benches/ETL_BENCHMARKS.md`](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge/blob/dev/benches/ETL_BENCHMARKS.md),
so the output pastes straight into that document's **Results** section next to the
Debezium / OpenMessaging / Airbyte baselines.

**The two headline scenarios (§5 Postgres → JSONL and §6 CSV → JSONL)** are
full-dataset ETL jobs on a 1,000,000-row seed-42 dataset, reporting throughput
**and** peak RSS against a Sling and a Meltano (`tap-*` → `target-jsonl`) baseline (see
[Results](#results--the-two-headline-etl-scenarios-1m-rows)). The remaining
scenarios (1 & 3 table→table copy, 2 CDC latency, 4 local IPC, 7 the MCP server,
8 Postgres' own tools, and 9 Kafka streaming) are additional coverage.

## Why this path is credible

Competing ETL/CDC tools publish "config in → data moved out" numbers. So do we:
scenarios 1 & 3 run through the app's zero-code `copy` command (a Postgres table
→ Postgres table job); scenario 2 runs a `postgres_cdc → null` route from a YAML
config applied over the app's HTTP API — the same action as clicking *Save* in
the UI. No scenario uses a Criterion micro-harness or hand-written Rust.

## Results — the two headline ETL scenarios (1M rows)

The two most common ETL jobs — **CSV → JSONL** and **Postgres → JSONL** — run on
the same seeded (seed 42) 7-column mixed-type dataset of 1,000,000 rows, against two
baselines — Sling (a compiled Go EL tool) and Meltano (`tap-*` → `target-jsonl`) —
reporting throughput **and** peak RSS (detailed writeups in §5 and §6 below). All
columns are measured on the same machine (this repo's Apple M1 host).

### A — CSV → JSONL (1,000,000 rows, ~116 MiB)

mq-bridge-app is measured **twice**, because the two configurations do different
work and each has a baseline it legitimately belongs against:

| Metric            | mq-bridge-app (typed) | mq-bridge-app (untyped) | Sling           | Meltano        |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Throughput        | **742,390 rows/s**    | **1,133,786 rows/s**    | 127,959 rows/s  | ~19,500 rows/s |
| Median wall-clock | 1.35 s                | 0.88 s                  | 7.82 s          | ~51 s          |
| Peak RSS          | 93.8 MiB              | 21.9 MiB                | 111.2 MiB       | 443.8 MiB      |
| Rows out          | 1,000,000             | 1,000,000               | 1,000,000       | 1,000,000      |

- **typed** runs a `transform` middleware that reproduces Sling's typing exactly,
  and the harness fails the run unless all 1,000,000 output records match. **This
  is the column to read against Sling** (~5.8x), and the only one that is
  like-for-like.
- **untyped** runs no middleware: every field stays the string the CSV reader
  produced. This is the column to read against **Meltano** (~58x), whose `tap-csv`
  likewise emits every field as a string — and it is the floor the transform's cost
  is measured against.

Quoting the untyped figure against Sling would overstate the margin (it would read
~8.9x); quoting the typed figure against Meltano understates it. See
[A note on the Sling comparison](#a-note-on-the-sling-comparison). Peak RSS
(measured with `/usr/bin/time -l`): untyped **21.9 MiB**, typed **93.8 MiB** — the
transform's per-row JSON decode/buffer adds ~72 MiB, still well under Meltano's
443.8 MiB and 17.4 MiB under Sling's 111.2 MiB even on the typed path.

Both mq-bridge-app columns are measured with the **mimalloc** global allocator,
which the shipped binaries use. It is the `mimalloc` cargo feature — on by
default, and also pulled in by the `bench` feature, so both documented builds
have it. To measure the system allocator instead, build with
`--no-default-features --features mq_bridge_app/bench` (the core feature set
without the app's `bench` alias). On this scenario it is worth ~+36% throughput for
~+33% peak RSS on the typed path; the Sling and Meltano columns are unaffected by
it. Sections A, B and C, §4, §7 and §8 are all mimalloc numbers. **§1/§3 (table→table)
and §2 (CDC latency) have not been re-measured** and still report system-allocator
figures — they are marked where they appear.

### B — Postgres → JSONL (1,000,000 rows, 7-col)

| Metric            | mq-bridge-app       | Sling           | Meltano        |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Throughput        | **338,066 rows/s**  | 122,774 rows/s  | 15,356 rows/s  |
| Median wall-clock | 2.96 s              | 8.15 s          | 65.1 s         |
| Peak RSS          | 39.8 MiB            | not yet measured| 599.7 MiB      |
| Rows out          | 1,000,000           | 1,000,000       | 1,000,000      |

`mq-bridge-app` moves the same 1M rows at **~40 MiB peak RSS** — an order of
magnitude leaner than Meltano's Python pipeline (444–600 MiB). Throughput and RSS
are single-machine, single-process batch numbers.

The mq-bridge-app column was re-measured on 2026-08-01 with the mimalloc allocator
(2 repeats after a discarded warmup, batch 1024 / concurrency 1). The Sling and
Meltano columns are carried over from the earlier session on the same machine and
dataset — neither tool changed, but this table is therefore not single-session.
Raising concurrency to 4 gives **384,615 rows/s** at 41.2 MiB.

> **The two Sling columns are not on equal footing — check which one you're
> reading.** In **A (CSV)** the *typed* mq-bridge-app column does the same per-row
> work as Sling: it runs a `transform` middleware reproducing Sling's typing, and
> the outputs are asserted identical row-for-row, so that ratio is like-for-like.
> (A's *untyped* column is not — it belongs against Meltano.) In **B (Postgres)**
> the comparison is not equalised at all: there mq-bridge-app passes values through
> untyped while Sling does schema inference and type conversion, which is real work
> it does and mq-bridge-app doesn't. B has no typed column yet.
> See [A note on the Sling comparison](#a-note-on-the-sling-comparison).

### C — Kafka → JSONL: mq-bridge-app vs. Arroyo (1,000,000 rows)

This is a deliberately narrow streaming comparison, not a third headline ETL
scenario. Both sides consume the same four-partition Kafka topic containing the
usual seven-column JSON row, project the same four columns (`id`, `first_name`,
`country`, `amount`), and write newline-delimited JSON. The run uses four-way
parallelism and Arroyo `0.15.0` (`ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo:0.15.0`).

| Tool | Median wall-clock | Throughput | Startup | Peak RSS |
| ---- | ----------------: | ---------: | ------: | -------: |
| mq-bridge-app passthrough (no transform) | 1.244 s | 803,640 rows/s | — | 105 MiB |
| mq-bridge-app projection (+ `transform`) | 1.472 s | 679,546 rows/s | — | 93 MiB |
| Arroyo projection | 1.764 s | 566,991 rows/s | 0.548 s | 362 MiB |

The mq-bridge-app rows are fresh results from 1 warmup + 3 timed runs with the
explicit release feature set `bench,kafka,mimalloc`. Arroyo's row is the existing
retained result (1 warmup + 5 timed runs), not a new Arroyo run. Both tools use
the same stopwatch: start the job and poll until all 1,000,000 output rows have
landed; Arroyo's one-off pipeline startup is reported separately. Output parity
was checked before quoting the comparison: both projected sinks were 65,615,161
bytes and contained the same 1,000,000 records. Arroyo's stateful features are
intentionally not exercised.

The delivery guarantees are not equivalent: Arroyo provides **exactly-once
processing within its checkpointed pipeline**, while mq-bridge-app provides
**at-least-once delivery** for the Kafka route. mq-bridge-app resumes from the
source's committed consumer offset, so a failure can replay records; the
`transform` measurement does not add deduplication or upgrade that guarantee.

The exact mq-bridge-app build command was:

```bash
cargo build -p mq-bridge-app --no-default-features \
  --features bench,kafka,mimalloc --release
```

The `mimalloc` allocator is included by the app's `bench` feature; do not compare
these rows with a system-allocator build.

### D — Kafka → native `.ss`: mq-bridge-app vs. Sea Streamer (1,000,000 rows)

This is a separate library/backend comparison. Both tools relay the original
Kafka payload from the same four-partition, 1,000,000-row topic without a
transform. mq-bridge-app writes its default `format=normal` file encoding: a
JSON `CanonicalMessage` envelope per record. Sea Streamer writes its native
framed and indexed `.ss` file. The Sea Streamer path uses the pinned official
`0.5.2` crates.

| Tool | Median wall-clock | Throughput | Peak RSS | Sink bytes |
| ---- | ----------------: | ---------: | -------: | ---------: |
| mq-bridge-app (`format=normal`, mimalloc) | 1.354 s | 738,297 rows/s | 109 MiB | 391,985,602 |
| Sea Streamer 0.5.2 relay (native `.ss`, system allocator) | 2.434 s | 410,786 rows/s | 689 MiB | 244,991,425 |
| Sea Streamer 0.5.2 relay (native `.ss`, mimalloc) | 2.235 s | 447,356 rows/s | 835 MiB | 244,991,425 |

All rows are fresh results from 1 warmup + 3 timed runs, using the same
stopwatch. Each Sea Streamer result was run with the repository-contained helper
and its output was verified with `sea-streamer-count` to contain exactly
1,000,000 messages. Its mimalloc build is a separate application-level allocator
measurement, not a Sea Streamer crate feature. The two native file formats are
not byte-for-byte equivalent, so the data supports a Kafka-to-file throughput
comparison—not a claim of identical sink encoding, delivery, or checkpoint
semantics. On these runs mq-bridge-app is 1.80x faster than Sea Streamer's default
allocator result and 1.65x faster than its mimalloc result.

The reproducible Sea Streamer helper is committed in
[`benches/etl/sea_streamer`](sea_streamer). It contains the relay and count
programs and pins the Sea Streamer `0.5.2` dependencies:

```bash
cargo build --manifest-path benches/etl/sea_streamer/Cargo.toml \
  --release --target-dir target
```

To add the allocator comparison, rebuild the same helper in the same target
directory with `--features mimalloc`, then run
`SEA_STREAMER_LABEL=sea-streamer-mimalloc REPEATS=3 ./benches/etl/run_kafka_stream.sh sea`.

## Fixed parameters (printed next to every number)

| Parameter     | Value                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Payload       | 256 B and 4 KiB JSON rows (both reported)         |
| Message count | 1 000 000 per run                                 |
| Batch sizes   | 1 / 128 (table→table §1 & §3); 1024 (§5, §6 & §9)  |
| Concurrency   | 1 and 4 route workers                             |
| Postgres      | `postgres:16-alpine`, `wal_level=logical`         |
| Warm-up       | 5 000-message pre-roll, excluded from timing      |
| Environment   | CPU model, cores, RAM, mq-bridge(-app) version    |

Payload rows are `{"id":<n>,"pad":"xxx…"}` padded to exactly 256 / 4096 bytes.

## One-time setup

```bash
# 1. Release binary. The published §5 CSV numbers are measured on the DEFAULT
#    (`full`) release build — the same artifact shipped via Homebrew and
#    cargo-binstall — so the figures describe what a user actually installs.
cargo build -p mq-bridge-app --release

#    A lean build is also supported and is enough for the Postgres scenarios;
#    it avoids the heavy `full` deps (rdkafka/librdkafka, grpc/protoc, ibm-mq)
#    and builds much faster. Numbers from the two builds should not be mixed in
#    one table. Give it its own CARGO_TARGET_DIR so it cannot overwrite the
#    default build's binary, and pass the same value when running the
#    benchmarks against it (the runners resolve BIN from it):
# CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target-lean cargo build -p mq-bridge-app \
#   --no-default-features --features bench --release
# CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target-lean benches/etl/run_pipeline.sh
#
#    For run_cdc_latency.sh use `bench-cdc` instead: CDC needs the postgres
#    logical-replication endpoint, which pulls aws-lc-sys (a slow C build) and
#    is therefore not in plain `bench`.
# CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target-lean cargo build -p mq-bridge-app \
#   --no-default-features --features bench-cdc --release

# 2. Postgres 16 with logical replication (mirrors the library's CDC compose).
benches/etl/seed.sh up

# 3. Optional — the Sling CLI baseline for §5/§6 (compiled Go EL tool).
#    Kept repo-local so a run never depends on what's on PATH; both runners
#    skip the Sling block if it's absent.
mkdir -p benches/etl/bin && curl -sL \
  "https://github.com/slingdata-io/sling-cli/releases/latest/download/sling_darwin_arm64.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xz -C benches/etl/bin sling
```

Requires Docker, `curl`, `python3` (sub-second timing), and `uv` (used by
`seed.sh` to run `gen_bench_data.py` for the §5/§6 dataset) on PATH. A host `psql`
is used if present; otherwise the harness runs `psql` inside the compose container,
so no host Postgres client is needed.

## Scenarios & commands

### 1 & 3 — bulk-insert / batched-vs-unbatched throughput

`copy` reads a seeded 1 000 000-row Postgres table and inserts into a fresh table,
wall-clocked. `rows/sec = 1 000 000 / elapsed`. The runner sweeps the full
payload × batch × concurrency matrix and re-seeds before each timed run:

```bash
benches/etl/run_throughput.sh          # -> benches/etl/results/throughput.csv
```

The single underlying command (what a user would type) is:

```bash
mq-bridge-app copy \
  --from 'postgres://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb?table=src_256&cursor_column=id&sslmode=disable' \
  --to   'postgres://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb?table=dst_256&auto_create_table=true&sslmode=disable' \
  --drain --batch-size 128 --concurrency 4
```

`cursor_column=id` reads the source table non-destructively, paging on the
monotonic `id` column (the sqlx cursor reader — an incremental-sync read like
Airbyte's). Each moved record is the source row as JSON
(`{"id":N,"payload":"…"}`); the `payload` column is sized to exactly 256 B / 4 KiB.
Scenario 3 (the batching lever) is the `batch=1` vs `batch=128` rows of the same
matrix. The library's Criterion harness additionally covers the `memory` backend.

### 2 — CDC event-to-sink latency

A `postgres_cdc → null` route ([`cdc_latency.yaml`](cdc_latency.yaml)) with the
`metrics` middleware on the input endpoint. The runner boots the app with
`--config cdc_latency.yaml`, then **starts the route via `POST /consumer-start`**
— the zero-code equivalent of clicking *Start* in the UI. (Consumers do **not**
auto-start headless, and `POST /config` only validates+saves; it does not start
routes.) It then inserts rows into the captured table, waits for the processed
counter to settle, and reads the `queue_message_processing_duration_seconds`
summary quantiles:

```bash
benches/etl/run_cdc_latency.sh         # -> benches/etl/results/cdc_latency.csv
```

Two behaviours to know (validated in a smoke run):

- **Use a permanent replication slot** (`temporary_slot: false`, as in the YAML):
  a temporary slot is dropped when its creating connection closes and races the
  streaming connection (`replication slot "…" does not exist`). The runner drops
  the slot before each run for a clean start.
- **CDC delivers at ~transaction granularity:** one multi-row transaction arrives
  as a *single* processed message. So `queue_messages_processed_total` counts
  delivered messages, not rows, and to get N change events (each with its own
  latency sample) you insert **N single-row transactions**, not one bulk
  `generate_series`. The runner waits for the counter to *stop increasing* rather
  than reaching an exact row total.

**What this measures (be honest when publishing):** the metric is the engine's
**per-event in-engine processing time on the consumer side** (decode + hand-off),
exposed as Prometheus summary quantiles. It is *not* the full Postgres
commit → sink wall-clock that Debezium reports end-to-end; it excludes
replication-slot/WAL propagation delay. Report it as "mq-bridge CDC processing
latency (p50/p95/p99)" and note the difference rather than implying it is
identical to Debezium's end-to-end figure. New CDC endpoint schemes were also
added to `copy` (`postgres-cdc://… → null:`), which gives a wall-clock CDC
*throughput* cross-check if you want one.

### 4 — Local IPC throughput (Unix domain socket, no metrics middleware)

A `static` load generator (process A) forwards messages to a receiver (process B)
over a real Unix domain socket — a `memory:` endpoint with a `unix://` topic, so
this is genuine cross-process IPC, not just an in-process channel
([`ipc_sender.yaml`](ipc_sender.yaml) / [`ipc_receiver.yaml`](ipc_receiver.yaml)).
Both sides run with `batch_size: 1024, concurrency: 1`. After starting both routes
via `POST /consumer-start` (same zero-code "Start" action as scenario 2) and a
2-second settle window, `rows/sec` is the delta of the receiver's own per-batch
transport log (`count=`/`bytes=` from `ipc_unix.rs`, no metrics crate involved)
over a 15-second sampling window:

```bash
benches/etl/run_ipc_throughput.sh      # -> benches/etl/results/ipc_throughput.csv
```

**Latest result: 1,769,700 rows/s** at `concurrency: 1`, sustained over a 5-minute
window — `RUN_SECONDS=300 benches/etl/run_ipc_throughput.sh`, i.e. the same script
with the sampling window widened from its 15-second default (system-allocator
baseline on the same run: 1,207,906 rows/s). An earlier
pre-mimalloc session measured 1,202,926 rows/s at `concurrency: 1`; `concurrency: 4`
gave a very slightly *lower* 1,167,428 rows/s there — expected, since both sides talk over a
single Unix socket connection either way, serialized through one mutex-guarded
stream; extra worker concurrency here only adds channel-handoff overhead with no
real parallelism to gain.)

### 5 — Postgres → JSONL vs. Meltano (`tap-postgres` → `target-jsonl`)

Same source table (`bench`: 1,000,000 rows, 7 mixed-type columns — `id,
first_name, country, amount, created_at, active, attributes` — seed 42, the same
dataset scenario 6 reads as CSV), same Postgres instance, same machine, both
one-shot full-table syncs to a local JSONL file. Both sides run through
[`run_meltano_bench.sh`](run_meltano_bench.sh) (1 warm-up + timed runs each,
median/stddev, output row count verified against the 1,000,000-row source):

```bash
benches/etl/run_meltano_bench.sh   # both sides -> results/meltano_pg_to_jsonl.csv
```

```bash
mq-bridge-app copy \
  --from 'postgres://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb?table=bench&cursor_column=id&sslmode=disable' \
  --to   'file:///tmp/mqb_bench_out.jsonl?format=raw' \
  --drain --batch-size 1024 --concurrency 1
```

Meltano side: `benches/etl/meltano_project/bench` (`meltano.yml` configures
`tap-postgres` selecting only `public-bench.*`, and `target-jsonl`), run via
`meltano run tap-postgres target-jsonl`, wall-clocked the same way.

Sling side: `sling run --src-conn … --src-stream public.bench --tgt-object file://…`
with `{"format":"jsonlines","file_max_rows":0}`, defaults otherwise.

| Tool | Config | rows/s | peak RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mq-bridge-app `copy` | batch_size 1024, concurrency 1 | **338,066** (2-run median 2.958 s, ±0.053) | 39.8 MiB |
| mq-bridge-app `copy` | batch_size 1024, concurrency 4 | **384,615** | 41.2 MiB |
| Sling | defaults | 122,774 | not yet measured |
| Meltano (`tap-postgres` → `target-jsonl`) | default Singer config | 15,356 | 599.7 MiB |

**mq-bridge-app is ~2.8x faster than Sling and ~22x faster than Meltano** (and ~15x
leaner than Meltano in peak memory) in this scenario — but see
[the note on Sling below](#a-note-on-the-sling-comparison), because that ratio is
not comparing equal work. No `metrics` middleware
involved here either — the `copy` CLI command never attaches a handler (see
scenario 4's CommandPublisher bug/fix note), so there's no metrics path to
accidentally measure in the first place.

The mq-bridge-app figures were re-measured on 2026-08-01 with mimalloc (2 timed
runs, 2.958s ±0.053, after a discarded warmup). The Sling figure (8.145s ±0.155)
and the Meltano figure are carried over from earlier sessions on the same machine
and dataset — neither tool changed, but this table is not single-session.

### 6 — CSV → JSONL vs. Meltano

A common ETL benchmark is a CSV → JSONL conversion. Same seeded dataset (`data/bench.csv`: 1,000,000
mixed-type rows — `id, first_name, country, amount, created_at, active,
attributes` — seed 42, ~116 MiB, generated by [`gen_bench_data.py`](gen_bench_data.py)),
same machine, both one-shot full-file CSV → local JSONL, one JSON object per
input row (string-valued fields — the shape both mq-bridge's CSV reader and
tap-csv emit):

```bash
benches/etl/run_csv_to_jsonl.sh   # all tools -> benches/etl/results/csv_to_jsonl.csv
```

Each tool is also a standalone script, so a single number can be re-measured
without re-running the matrix. They append to the same results CSV, each replacing
only its own row:

```bash
benches/etl/run_csv_mqb.sh              # mq-bridge-app, typed (transform)
benches/etl/run_csv_mqb.sh --untyped    # mq-bridge-app, untyped (no middleware)
benches/etl/run_csv_sling.sh
benches/etl/run_csv_meltano.sh
benches/etl/run_csv_parity.sh           # asserts typed output == Sling's
```

The two mq-bridge-app configurations differ only in the middleware suffix on the
output endpoint:

```bash
# untyped — every field stays the string the CSV reader produced
mq-bridge-app copy \
  --from 'file:///…/benches/etl/data/bench.csv?format=csv' \
  --to   'file:///tmp/mqb_csv_out.jsonl?format=raw' \
  --drain --batch-size 1024 --concurrency 1

# typed — reproduces Sling's typing, and is what §5's Sling ratio compares
mq-bridge-app copy \
  --from 'file:///…/benches/etl/data/bench.csv?format=csv' \
  --to   'file:///tmp/mqb_csv_out.jsonl?format=raw|transform?schema_file=…/schemas/bench.json' \
  --drain --batch-size 1024 --concurrency 1
```

Meltano side: same `meltano_project/bench` project with a `tap-csv` extractor
(pinned to `tap-csv 1.3.2`) → `target-jsonl 0.1.4`, run via
`meltano run tap-csv target-jsonl`. Install the plugin once with
`(cd meltano_project/bench && ../.venv/bin/meltano install extractor tap-csv)`.

Sling side: `sling run --src-stream file://…bench.csv --tgt-object file://…` with
`{"format":"jsonlines","file_max_rows":0}`, defaults otherwise.

| Tool | Config | rows/s | peak RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mq-bridge-app `copy` (typed) | batch_size 1024, concurrency 1, `transform` (schemas/bench.json) | **742,390** (2-run median 1.347s, ±0.001) | 93.8 MiB |
| mq-bridge-app `copy` (untyped) | batch_size 1024, concurrency 1, no middleware | **1,133,786** (2-run median 0.882s, ±0.001) | 21.9 MiB |
| Sling | defaults | 127,959 (2-run median 7.815s, ±0.077) | 111.2 MiB |
| Meltano (`tap-csv` → `target-jsonl`) | default Singer config | ~19,500 (clean runs 49.7s / 53.1s; fuller median pending) | 443.8 MiB |

**Typed vs Sling: ~5.8x** — equal work, asserted identical outputs. **Untyped vs
Meltano: ~58x** — both emit strings. Those are the two defensible ratios; see
[the note below](#a-note-on-the-sling-comparison) for why they are not
interchangeable.

The typed cost is explicit here rather than hidden in a single number: the
transform adds **0.47 s per 1,000,000 rows (~0.47 µs/row, ~35% of the typed
wall-clock)**. An earlier revision of the transform cost 2.10 s per 1M rows (2.1
µs/row, 64%), which is why the previously published typed figure was 303,214.

**The two mq-bridge-app columns are not from the same session as the Sling and
Meltano columns.** mq-bridge-app was re-measured on 2026-08-01 after the switch to
the mimalloc allocator (2 repeats each after a discarded warmup, spread ±0.001 s);
Sling and Meltano are carried over from earlier sessions on the same machine and
dataset (Sling 2026-07-19). Sling has been a stable control across three sessions
here — 119,217 / 128,766 / 127,959 rows/s — which is the basis for treating the
carried-over columns as still valid, but a same-session re-run of all four columns
is the cleaner way to publish these ratios and has not been done yet.

For reference, the pre-mimalloc figures this table replaced were 540,248 typed /
784,313 untyped, measured 2026-07-19 in a back-to-back session with Sling; the
untyped figure was measured three times there (788,022 / 784,313 / 768,639 rows/s),
a ~2.5% spread that is the honest run-to-run variance on this host.

### A note on the Sling comparison

Sling does schema inference and type conversion: given a CSV row it emits typed
values and re-parses nested JSON into real objects. mq-bridge-app's readers do not
infer types — they pass values through as strings. Comparing those two directly
would time a string passthrough against a tool that parses and re-types every row,
which is not a benchmark, so the two scenarios handle it differently.

**§5 (CSV → JSONL) — equal work, ratio is like-for-like.** The mq-bridge-app run
carries a `transform` middleware ([`schemas/bench.json`](schemas/bench.json)) that
reproduces Sling's output exactly: `coerce` widens the `id` string to an integer,
and `contentMediaType: application/json` decodes the embedded `attributes` document
into a nested object. Both tools then emit the same records:

```jsonc
// sling (defaults) and mq-bridge-app (+ transform) — identical records
{"id":1,"amount":"6767.32","attributes":{"score":2.501,"tier":"free"}}
```

This is asserted, not assumed: [`compare_jsonl.py`](compare_jsonl.py) diffs the two
outputs record-by-record and **fails the run** on any mismatch, so the numbers in §5
cannot be published unless all 1,000,000 rows match. Records are compared as parsed
JSON — mq-bridge-app preserves the source column order inside `attributes` while
Sling alphabetizes it, which is a serialization difference, not a data one.

Making the work equal is not free, and the harness measures the cost directly by
running mq-bridge-app both ways in the same session: **1,133,786 untyped → 742,390
typed**, i.e. the transform costs ~0.47 µs/row (~35% of wall-clock). The margin
against Sling is therefore ~5.8x, not the ~8.9x the untyped run would suggest.

Both configurations stay published on purpose. The untyped number is not a
discarded draft — it is the correct comparison against any tool that also does no
transformation (Meltano's `tap-csv` emits every field as a string), and it is what
makes the transform's cost auditable instead of baked invisibly into one figure.
What it must *not* be used for is a comparison against a type-inferring tool.

Historical note: this scenario previously published 303,214 rows/s typed, against
an untyped 834,724 — a ~2.7x cost for the same schema. A later optimization of the
transform middleware cut that to ~1.45x. Sling is a useful control across all of
it, measuring 119,217 → 128,766 → 127,959 rows/s in three separate sessions on this
machine, so the movement in the typed number is real engine work rather than a
drifting baseline.

**§6 (Postgres → JSONL) — not yet equalised.** That scenario still runs
mq-bridge-app untyped against a type-inferring Sling, so part of its ~2.8x gap is
mq-bridge-app doing less. Read it with that attached. Applying the same treatment
there needs a Postgres-shaped schema (the driver already returns typed values for
some columns, so it is not a copy of `bench.json`) and a re-run.

**A note on this benchmark:**

- **The CSV number does not scale with batch size or concurrency.** A `file://`
  source is a single sequential reader, so extra route workers can't parallelize
  the read; the bottleneck is per-row CSV→JSON conversion on the one reader, not
  I/O or batching. After the CSV-path optimization and the move to mimalloc this
  untyped baseline sits at ~1.13M. The raw byte-passthrough `file→file` reference
  it used to be compared against (~880k, no CSV decode) predates mimalloc and has
  not been re-run, so the two are no longer directly comparable.

### 7 — MCP server: tool-call latency, route throughput, agent token cost

Every scenario above drives the engine from a CLI or a YAML config. This one
drives it the way an **LLM agent** does: through the MCP server, over its real
stdio transport. [`mcp_bench.py`](mcp_bench.py) is a genuine MCP client — it spawns
`mq-bridge-app mcp --transport stdio` and speaks JSON-RPC to it exactly as Claude
Code would, so the numbers include the framing, serialization and process-boundary
cost an agent actually pays. Nothing reaches into the process.

The job is the **same CSV → JSONL work as §6, on the same 1M-row dataset**, on
purpose: the question is not how fast the MCP server is in isolation, but whether
routing a job through a tool call costs anything per row versus the `copy` CLI. A
different workload would answer nothing.

```bash
benches/etl/run_mcp_bench.sh          # -> results/mcp_bench.json (+ a row in results/csv_to_jsonl.csv)
REPEATS=3 LATENCY_CALLS=1000 benches/etl/run_mcp_bench.sh
```

<!-- ANCHOR: mcp_results -->
| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tool-call round-trip latency (200 calls) | **p50 0.060 ms** · p95 0.080 ms · p99 0.583 ms |
| 1M-row CSV → JSONL via `start_route` (client wall-clock, 2 runs) | **1,176,489 rows/s** (0.850 s ±0.023) |
| Same job, server's own `average_messages_per_second` | 1,191,579 rows/s |
| `copy` CLI baseline, same dataset (§6 untyped) | 1,133,786 rows/s (2-run median 0.882 s, ±0.001) |
| Agent tool traffic to move the whole dataset | **1,526 bytes** (~381 tokens, 3 calls) |
| The same 116.3 MiB through a model's context | ~30.5M tokens |
<!-- ANCHOR_END: mcp_results -->

- **The MCP interface costs one round-trip, not a per-row tax.** Client wall-clock
  lands within ~4% of the `copy` CLI on the same dataset and inside this host's
  run-to-run spread — here it measures slightly *above* the CLI, which is variance,
  not the MCP path being faster. What separates them is a fixed ~30-55 ms — route
  startup plus up to one 50 ms completion poll — not a rate difference: the server's
  own average over the identical job (1,191,579 rows/s) lands beside the CLI's
  1,133,786 rows/s. Scale the dataset and the gap stays constant.
- **Agent token cost is flat in the number of rows moved** — the one row here with
  no CLI counterpart. An agent moves the dataset with three tool calls
  (`start_route`, one `route_status`, `stop_route`) totalling 1,526 bytes of
  JSON-RPC. The rows never enter the model's context, so the same ~1.5 KB moves 1M
  rows or 1,000 — only the digits of the counters differ. Passing the 116.3 MiB
  through a context window instead would cost ~30.5M tokens (~4 bytes/token, an
  estimate), which no context window holds at any price.

<details>
<summary><b>Methodology notes</b> — so nothing here is quotable out of context</summary>

- The throughput number is **client-side wall-clock** from the `start_route` call
  to observing `finished: true`, including route startup and completion-detection
  lag. It is the pessimistic figure of the two, which is why it is the one quoted.
- The server-side figure is `average_messages_per_second` (total messages over the
  span in which they moved), **not** the instantaneous `messages_per_second`, which
  decays to ~0 within a second of a drain finishing and cannot describe a completed
  job. That distinction is why the average was added to `route_status`; without it
  a sub-second-to-few-second job is unmeasurable through the tools.
- The completion poll is 50 ms. At 200 ms the poll lag dominated the wall-clock; at
  20 ms the polls measurably perturbed the run they were measuring.
- The **latency** row is `route_status` with nothing running — a map lookup over an
  empty map, so what is measured is the interface, not work.
- The **token** row counts only the three calls an agent makes. The harness itself
  polls ~26 times (~15 KB); publishing *that* as the agent's cost would be an
  artifact of the measurement, not a property of the server.
- `mcp_bench.py` calls `server_info` first and **aborts on a debug build**. An
  earlier MCP measurement session was silently invalidated by a stale debug binary;
  the check exists so that cannot recur.
- No `metrics` middleware anywhere on the path. The per-route counters
  `route_status` reports are the same ones the web UI uses and are not the metrics
  crate.

### 8 — Postgres → file vs. the tools that ship with Postgres

The Meltano and Sling comparisons line mq-bridge-app up against other ETL tools.
This one lines it up against what a Postgres user **already has installed**, which
is the more common reference point. The peer is **`psql \copy … TO … (FORMAT csv,
HEADER true)`**: both sides read the same `bench` table and write the same CSV, so
the ratio is meaningful. **`pg_dump`** is in the table too, but as a floor rather
than a peer — it writes a restore format and never decodes a row, so it marks the
cost of getting bytes out of Postgres at all.

```bash
benches/etl/seed.sh up && benches/etl/seed.sh bench 1000000
# A HOST psql/pg_dump is required here (see below). macOS:
brew install libpq && export PATH="$(brew --prefix libpq)/bin:$PATH"
BATCH=32768 CONC=4 benches/etl/run_pg_vendor.sh   # -> results/pg_vendor.csv
```

> **Measured 2026-08-05 on an idle machine.** The `psql \copy` and `pg_dump`
> baselines are from the 0.2.13 session and are unchanged — neither takes a batch
> size, so there was nothing to re-measure. Every mq-bridge-app cell in §8a, §8b
> and §8c was re-measured together at `--batch-size 32768` on a later build, with
> 1 warmup and 3 timed runs per cell and a landed-row check on each.

#### 8a — vs. `psql \copy`

1M rows, batch 32768 / concurrency 4, median of 3:

| Tool | rows/s | median | on disk | writes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `pg_dump` (floor, not a peer) | 660,066 | 1.515 s | 111 MB | COPY-block SQL script |
| `psql \copy` → csv | 668,449 | 1.496 s | 129 MB | csv |
| mq-bridge-app → csv | 498,504 | 2.006 s | 129 MB | csv |

- **`psql \copy` is ~1.34x faster, and being faster is the expected result.** It is
  a byte pump: the server serializes CSV in C inside the backend and psql copies
  bytes from the socket to a file, never parsing a row, in one query.
  mq-bridge-app issues one keyset query per batch, decodes every value into a
  typed message, and re-serializes it — a full decode/encode round trip per row.
  The two CSVs are identical (parity-checked by value: 1,000,000 rows equal,
  10,091 differing only in float spelling).
- **Batch size is the parameter that matters here.** At `--batch-size 1024` the
  same job runs at 356,252 rows/s (2.807 s) — 1.9x behind `\copy` — because the
  per-batch query cost is paid ~977 times instead of ~31. Nothing else changed.
- **What that cost buys** is that the same command targets any other sink — a
  broker, a second database, object storage, compressed or encrypted — where
  `\copy` writes one local CSV and stops. For a comparison against tools doing the
  *same* typed-pipeline work, see scenarios 5 and 6.

#### 8b — Output formats

The same read, written seven ways (batch 32768 / concurrency 4, median of 3, all
seven measured in one session). The read column is the reverse trip: that file
back in through mq-bridge-app, same parameters, written to a `raw` sink.

| Format | write rows/s | on disk | read rows/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `format=csv` | 498,504 | 128,982,268 | 920,810 |
| `format=normal` | 499,251 | 320,985,602 | 1,137,656 |
| `format=json` | 499,251 | 286,982,210 | 687,757 |
| `format=text` | 492,853 | 334,985,602 | 1,077,586 |
| `format=raw` | 489,236 | 208,982,210 | 3,802,281 |
| `format=normal&compression=lz4` | 501,350 | 73,225,866 | 1,067,235 |
| `format=normal&compression=zstd` | 467,954 | 45,417,349 | 953,288 |

> The two compressed **write** cells are from an interleaved re-measurement
> (lz4/zstd/lz4/zstd, 1 warmup + 3 timed each). The first pass put lz4 at 392,927,
> below zstd — implausible for the cheaper codec, and it did not reproduce in
> either later pair. Everything else in the table is from the single session.

- **Writes are source-bound; reads are not.** The five uncompressed write cells land
  within ~2% of each other (489,236-499,251) because the Postgres cursor is the
  limit, not the sink — at this batch size it tops out near 499k rows/s. The read
  column, where the same sinks are fed by a file instead, spans **5.5x**
  (687,757 to 3,802,281) and every cell in it beats the write column. So treat the
  write column as a floor for the sink, not a measurement of it; the format only
  starts to matter once the source stops being the constraint.
- **`normal` is the interchange format** — the whole message envelope as JSON — and
  it is the one to reach for. A UTF-8 payload is written as a plain string; only a
  non-UTF-8 payload is base64-encoded, into a separate `payload_base64` field
  (mutually exclusive with `payload`, mirroring the CloudEvents `data`/`data_base64`
  split). `text` (payload as a string) and `json` (payload as a JSON value) carry the
  same envelope including `message_id`; `raw` writes the payload alone — smallest and
  by far the fastest to read, but no envelope, so no `message_id`. All read back;
  verified at 1M records each.
- **`normal` is both smaller and faster than `text`** — 321 MB against 335 MB, and
  1,137,656 against 1,077,586 rows/s on read — so there is no case for choosing
  `text` over it on either axis. `text` remains the right choice only when the
  consumer requires the payload as an opaque string field.
- **`json` is the slowest format to read**, at 687,757 against `normal`'s 1,137,656.
  It is the only one that materializes the payload into a `serde_json::Value` and
  re-serializes it; the others hand bytes through. Choose it when you want the
  payload as queryable JSON, not for speed.
- **CSV cannot be compressed** — the endpoint rejects the combination — so the
  compressed cells use `normal`, which is the right pairing anyway.
- **zstd for size, lz4 for speed.** zstd is **1.6x smaller** (45.4 MB against
  73.2 MB; 7.1x smaller than uncompressed `normal`, and *2.8x smaller than the CSV*
  while carrying strictly more), and costs ~7% against lz4 on write (467,954 vs
  501,350) and ~11% on read (953,288 vs 1,067,235). zstd is the default
  recommendation: 1.6x on disk is worth ~10% of CPU for almost any at-rest or
  transfer use. Pick lz4 when the pipeline is CPU-bound and the bytes are transient.
- **What compression costs depends on which end is the constraint.** The codec
  always burns CPU; whether that CPU is on the critical path is the whole question.
  On write here it mostly is not — lz4's 501,350 sits inside the ~2% spread of the
  uncompressed cells and zstd's 467,954 is only ~6% under, because the Postgres
  source, not the sink, sets the pace. On read there is no slow source to hide
  behind and the cost surfaces in full: ~6% for lz4 and ~16% for zstd against
  uncompressed `normal`, all of it landing on the file source's single reader
  thread. Measure this on your own source rate rather than reading either number as
  the codec's price.

#### 8c — Round trip

Does the interchange format survive a full trip out and back? The zstd file from
§8b is read in again, written out as uncompressed `normal`, and compared
byte-for-byte against the *same* file decoded by the external `zstd` CLI.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Records restored | 1,000,000 |
| Elapsed | 1.067 s |
| Result | byte-identical, **including `message_id`** |

- **Compare against that same file, not a re-read.** Comparing the restore against
  a separately written `normal` file would be wrong, and is a mistake worth naming:
  that file is a different read of Postgres, and Postgres rows carry no
  `message_id`, so the sink mints a fresh one per ingestion. Two independent reads
  disagree on `message_id` by construction, which looks exactly like "the sink
  regenerates ids on write" — a bug that is not there.
- **Row counts come from the external `zstd`/`lz4` CLIs**, not from mq-bridge:
  verifying a writer with its own reader would hide a bug in both, and this doubles
  as a check that the concatenated members decode as one stream.
- **Restore does not speed up with `--concurrency`.** The file source does not
  parallelize — one reader thread owns decode, delimiter splitting and message
  construction — which is also why the read column above is flat in
  `--concurrency`.

#### 8d — Methodology

<details>
<summary><b>Methodology notes for all of §8</b> — the host-client guard, <code>pg_dump</code>, and how parity is checked</summary>

- **This scenario refuses to run without a host `psql` and `pg_dump`**, and says
  why — unlike every other scenario. `lib.sh` otherwise falls back to the client
  inside the compose container, which would invalidate the comparison twice over:
  `\copy` writes client-side, so the CSV would land on container overlayfs instead
  of host disk, and the client would reach the server over a container-local socket
  rather than the TCP connection mq-bridge-app uses. Different disk, different
  network path — a faster number that is not a comparison. The guard exists because
  that failure is silent.
- **`pg_dump` is published as a floor, not as a peer.** A dump is a *restore
  format* — a COPY-block SQL script, not interchange data — and it skips the
  `ORDER BY` this comparison needs, skips CSV quoting, and writes less (111 MB
  against 129 MB). So it is not a head-to-head that anyone won or lost: it is the
  cost of getting bytes out of Postgres at all, and therefore the bound no
  extraction tool can beat. Read the row that way. `mongodump` is the same
  category; `mongoexport --type=json` would be the fair Mongo peer and is not
  wired up yet.
- **Parity is checked by value, not by bytes.** The two outputs are not
  byte-identical and should not be: a `double precision` holding a whole number
  renders as `7535.0` from the sink (it serializes an f64) and as `7535` from
  Postgres — 10,091 of 1,000,000 rows. The runner compares numeric fields as
  numbers and everything else exactly, and reports `1000000 rows equal`. Casting
  the baseline with `to_char`, or reseeding to avoid whole-valued floats, would
  make a byte comparison pass by shaping the data to fit the claim.
