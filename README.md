`mq-bridge-app` is a **fast, single-command ETL and data-movement tool** built in Rust — and, on top of the same engine, a multi-protocol bridge and traffic workbench for messaging.

It ships in **three forms that share one engine and one config format**: a **desktop app** (visual workbench), a **CLI / server** (headless bridge and one-line `copy`), and a **library** (embed the engine in Rust, Python, or Node.js). Design a route once, run it anywhere — no rewrite in between.

Supported integration types include **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ (AMQP)**, **NATS**, **AWS SQS**, **MQTT**, **IBM MQ** (optional), **HTTP**, **gRPC**, **ZeroMQ**, **MongoDB**, **sqlx (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL)**, and filesystem endpoints.

> 📖 **All documentation lives in the [documentation book](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/)** — installation, quick start, tutorials, cookbook, connector reference, CLI, MCP, and performance tuning. This README is only a short overview; the book is the single source of truth.

## A quick taste

At its core is a zero-config `copy` command that moves data between databases, queues, and files in a single line of bash — no YAML, no pipeline definition, no code:

```bash
mqb copy \
  'postgres://${PGUSER}:${PGPASSWORD}@localhost/db?table=src&sslmode=disable' \
  'file://out.jsonl?format=raw' \
  --filter 'amount > 100' \
  --drain
```

The **scheme selects the endpoint** and **query parameters configure it**, so any source→sink pair (Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, NATS, Redis, MongoDB, files, …) is just one URL each. And it's quick.

Use `--resume` when the source has a safe native position (for example a Kafka
consumer group, MongoDB change-stream cursor, Postgres CDC slot, or an explicitly
configured SQL cursor). The legacy `--from ... --to ...` spelling remains supported.

## The three ways to run it

Test connections and dial in a route in the Postman-inspired UI, export the JSON/YAML, then run that config as a service or from library code. One engine, one config format.

| Form | What it is | Quick install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Desktop app (UI)** | The visual workbench — build/test routes, run request/response traffic, inspect message history | `brew install --cask marcomq/tap/mq-bridge` |
| **CLI / server** | Headless binary: a one-line `copy`, a drain-then-exit batch job, or a long-lived bridge (can also serve the same UI in a browser) | `brew install marcomq/tap/mq-bridge-app` |
| **Library** | The engine embedded in your own code — native **Rust**, **Python**, or **Node.js** bindings | `cargo add` / `pip` / `npm` |

**Learn each form in the book:** [the three ways to run it](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/getting-started/run-forms.html) · [the desktop / web UI](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/getting-started/desktop-ui.html) · [CLI commands](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/reference/cli.html) · [MCP server](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/MCP.html) · [library bindings](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/reference/bindings.html).

## Install

`brew` is the quickest path on **macOS and Linux**:

```bash
brew install marcomq/tap/mq-bridge-app         # CLI / server
brew install --cask marcomq/tap/mq-bridge      # desktop app
```

On **Windows**, install the CLI with `cargo binstall mq-bridge-app`, or download the desktop installer / CLI from the [Releases page](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge-app/releases). Also available via `cargo install mq-bridge-app` (from source) and the Docker image `ghcr.io/marcomq/mq-bridge-app:latest`.

→ Every install method and platform (including the IBM MQ build and Docker) is in the **[Install guide](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/INSTALL.html)**; to compile from source see [Building](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/BUILD.html).

## Use it from an AI agent

The same binary is an MCP server, so an agent can move data without the rows passing through its context:

```bash
mqb mcp install          # register with Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor
```

- MCP Registry name: `mcp-name: io.github.marcomq/mq-bridge-app`

## Features

- **Multi-protocol bridging** — Kafka, IBM MQ, NATS, AMQP (RabbitMQ), MQTT, AWS SQS, gRPC, ZeroMQ, MongoDB, sqlx (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL), HTTP, and files. Act as an HTTP server *and* client, with full request-response support.
- **Middleware chains** — retries, dead-letter queues, deduplication, rate limiting, buffering, transforms, weak-join correlation, and more, wrapping any endpoint.
- **Built-in web UI** — Svelte-based management for publishers, consumers, routes, runtime status, presets, and imports; the same UI the CLI serves in a browser.
- **Native plugins** — load an endpoint or middleware this binary never compiled (Pulsar, an in-house transport) from a shared library, via `plugins:` in the config or `--plugin <path>`, and use it by name in routes. No special build needed; plugin paths are read only at startup, so adding one means editing the trusted startup configuration and restarting: [Native plugins](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/extending/plugins.html).
- **Observability** — structured JSON logging and a Prometheus metrics endpoint.
- **Flexible configuration** — hierarchical files (YAML/JSON/TOML) plus environment variables, suited to Container/Kubernetes.
- **Security & storage** — config security modes (plain / extracted secrets / encrypted config / persistent encrypted history), encryption at rest, and local-first operation.
- **High performance** — Rust + Tokio: low latency, high concurrency, small memory footprint.

## Why not just an API client?

`mq-bridge-app`'s UI overlaps with API clients like Postman, Bruno, Insomnia, and Hoppscotch, but its center of gravity is different: message bridging, runtime operation, and long-lived route management rather than just request composition. Exact feature sets vary by product and edition; this captures the difference in emphasis.

| Capability | mq-bridge | Postman | Bruno | Insomnia | Hoppscotch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic HTTP/API requests | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Scripting | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cookie jar | Not yet | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ |
| Multipart forms | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Hex-level payload debugging | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Broker pub/sub workflow | ✓ | MQTT | — | — | MQTT |
| Long-lived consumers/routes | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Bridge traffic between protocols | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Replay messages | ✓ | ~ | — | — | ~ |
| Local-first workspace | ✓ | ~ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ |
| Git-friendly config | ✓ | ~ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ |
| Cloud sync by default | — | ✓ | — | Optional | Optional |
| AI / agent features | — | ✓ | — | ~ | ~ |
| Encrypted config | ✓ | ~ | ~ | ~ | ~ |

Use Postman/Bruno when your main job is crafting and sharing API requests; use `mq-bridge-app` when you need to connect systems, move messages between protocols, inspect live traffic, and manage bridge-style runtime configuration.

## Performance

A CSV → JSONL conversion hit **1,133,786 rows/s**; the same job **through an MCP tool call** ran at **1,176,489 rows/s** while costing an agent a *flat* ~381 tokens regardless of row count, because the rows never enter the model's context.

On a Kafka → file relay using mq-bridge-app's default file format and no transform,
the same engine was up to **65% faster than Sea Streamer**; the native file-format caveats are detailed in the linked benchmark documentation.

## Test on nats / kafka / postgres ....

For testing, [docker-compose files](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge/tree/main/tests/integration/docker-compose) are available for supported backends:
```bash
docker-compose -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcomq/mq-bridge/main/tests/integration/docker-compose/postgres.yml up
```

## How it's built

`mq-bridge-app` uses the [`mq-bridge`](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge) engine *on itself* — the management UI is served through the engine's own HTTP-request/response routing, and the UI form is generated from the Rust config schema (no hand-written form code). See [How the app is built](https://marcomq.github.io/mq-bridge-app/getting-started/app-architecture.html).

## Status

Active development. Originally the reference implementation and testbed for the [`mq-bridge`](https://github.com/marcomq/mq-bridge) engine. The UI/Tauri layer is a working demo rather than a reference implementation — test before relying on it in production.
